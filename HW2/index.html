Nabil searched for months for a donor to no avail until one day he received a message. 
The message stated that there was someone willing to donate their organ, however Nabil would have to travel to Koen Kaen, Thailand.
Upon arrival to Koen Kaen, Nabil met up with Daniel and they both went to the hospital to start the organ transfer.
As Nabil was sedated and asleep, Vargas stole Nabils organs. 
Nabil awakes, just in time as Vargas begins to escapes, to recover his organs.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. 
If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
Gradius (1985) most closely resembles my game (although any shoot em up game will suffice as well).
Only code that was borrowed was the Phaser shoot bullet code. Enemy shooting was modified based off of this reference.
