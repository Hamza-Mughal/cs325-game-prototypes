Actions player can perform is moving upwards by mouse clicking. The system dynamic is that the hole spawns randomly, so it is up to the player to be smart about their movement.
The core mechanic of the game is to get through the ring of fire alive.

Game mechanic being evaluated is whether player speed is good and if ring of fires are too far apart or too tight for hard/easy passage.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Player has to have good movement to pass through otherwise he/she will restart. Ring of fires are psuedo-random.
