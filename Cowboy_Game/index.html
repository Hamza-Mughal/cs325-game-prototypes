<h2>Stop the Meteors!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Space cowboy saves Earth by killing asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Cowboy and asteroid heading toward Earth.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
Input that was used is the use of the arrow keys to control the player.
Randomness in the game is set by how the asteroids move back and forth.
Genre of the game is the space shooter genre.
Play style in this game is using the cowboy to destroy Asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should have a sense of accomplishment as he/she defeats Asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Player can move left, right, up, down by using the arrow keys. If the player wants to continously move, he/she has to hold down the arrow key, otherwise the player will stop.
The core mechanic of the game is that the player controls the Cowboy upwards towards the asteroids. As the player destroys Asteroids, he/she earns 100 points per Asteroid destroyed.
There are three waves to the game, so surviving a wave earns the player 500 points.
As more asteroids are destroyed, the more points the player gets. Surviving all three waves nets in the player saving Earth.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Prototype is evaluating moving the player around to destroy the asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
The player controls the cowboy and uses the cowboy to defeat the sprites. There are three different levels, music, and moving enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
The game is set in the year 2100 where everyone gets along. The characters are the scientists, the President of the United States, and Cowboy Nabil.
Backstory: Nabil was a lonely farmers boy in the middle of Texas. He did not have much to do daily, so he took up horse back riding and thus became a Cowboy. One day, Nabil was looking into the sky and saw stars.
Nabil was amazed by the beauty of what he saw, and avowed, one day, that he would visit space and see this beauty in person. He later became a certified Cowboy-Astronaut by NASA after completing the rigorous training at NASA camp.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story (or you envision a story for the full game), summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
Scientists have discovered asteroids in Earth's hemisphere when they did their daily telescope sight seeing in space. Immediately, the President of the United States was informed and ordered the asteroids destroyed.
Because there were no missile could reach the asteroids in time, Cowboy Nabil was sent into space on the most high tech rocket to date nicknamed Vargas. Immediately, Nabil reaches the asteroid and fends off against them
in the race against time to save Earth from doom!
